Create your iOS Base project in just a few seconds by executing a script and answering some project questions. This is what we use to get started with a new iOS project from scratch!

Swift Project Template provides us with a base iOS project template along with and a swift script to make naming customizations on it.

iOS project has the following configuration:

* Targets
  * Test: Unit tests working with Quick and Nimble.
  * UITest: Functional tests working with Nimble matcher.
  * App Production Target.
  * App Staging Target. Same app source code with a different bundle id, it points to a different Restful API (staging one).

* Project Configuration
  * R-Swift integration.
  * Warnings for TODO and FIXME comments.
  * Swift Lint integration.
  * `podfile` containing most used libraries by us.
    - Realm, Alamofire, RxSwift, Eureka and many others.

* Networking
  * `Alamofire` networking library.
